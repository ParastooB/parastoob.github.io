description: I recieved the competitive NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award funding to work on this project. My contribution were 1) Implemented multithreading for simultaneous interaction in continuous time to develop a more realistic communication protocol. 2) Toned the algorithm leading to an under 10 second simulation runtime for 100 agents and less than a minute real-time performance for 20 android devices. 3) Learned effective communication of complex topics by presenting my research at CUCSC.
